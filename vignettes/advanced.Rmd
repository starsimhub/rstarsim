## Advanced usage example

This example illustrates how to creating a custom disease module. It is a translation of Starsim's [Diseases developer tutorial](https://docs.starsim.org/tutorials/dev_tut_diseases.html) to R.

To recap that tutorial, the main customizations we are performing here are:
1. In `__init__()` we added the extra pars and states needed for our model.
2. We defined infectious to include both infected and exposed people - this means that we can just reuse the existing logic for how the SIR model handles transmission.
3. We updated `step_state()` and `step_die()` to include changes to the exposed state.
4. We rewrote `set_prognoses()` to include the new exposed state.

SEIR <- PyClass("SEIR", 
  inherit = ss$SIR, # Inherit from the SIR class
  defs = list(`__module__` = "SEIR",

    # Define the __init__ method
    `__init__` = function(self, pars = py_none(), ...) {
      ss$SIR$`__init__`(self) # Call the parent init method

      # Parameters specific to SEIR: duration of exposure
      self$define_pars(
          dur_exp = ss$lognorm_ex(0.5), # Define an explicit ("ex") lognormal distribution with a mean of 0.5
      )
      self$update_pars(pars, ...)

      # Additional states beyond the SIR ones
      self$define_states(
          ss$State('exposed', label='Exposed'),
          ss$FloatArr('ti_exposed', label='TIme of exposure'),
      )
      return(py_none())
